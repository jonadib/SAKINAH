                  <p class="small muted bio">
                    Sharif Osman bin Hadi (born June 30, 1993, Nalchhiti, Jhalokathi) was a politically conscious
                    educator,
                    social worker, and an uncompromising revolutionary voice. Raised in a religious environment, he
                    studied
                    Political Science at the University of Dhaka and later joined the teaching profession.

                    During the July 2024 mass uprising, he emerged as a frontline organizer and coordinator, providing
                    leadership at a critical moment. After the fall of Sheikh Hasina, he came into prominence as the
                    co-founder
                    and spokesperson of the Inqilab Manch. His voice was clear and unwavering on issues such as justice
                    for the
                    July martyrs, ending impunity, political accountability, and resistance against state
                    authoritarianism. He
                    believed that a state survives through justice—not through fear or servitude.

                    On December 12, 2025, he was shot in a planned armed attack in Paltan, Dhaka, and on December 18 he
                    attained
                    martyrdom at Singapore General Hospital. At just 32, his body fell silent, but the questions he
                    raised, the
                    struggles he waged, and the consciousness he ignited did not. Sharif Osman bin Hadi is no longer
                    just a
                    name; he is a legacy—one that continues to compel a new generation to stand up.
