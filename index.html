              <p class="small muted bio">
                Sharif Osman bin Hadi (born June 30, 1993, Nalchhiti, Jhalokathi) was a politically conscious
                educator, social worker, and an uncompromising revolutionary voice. Raised in a religious
                environment, he studied Political Science at the University of Dhaka and later joined the teaching
                profession.

                During the July 2024 mass uprising, he emerged as a frontline organizer and coordinator, providing
                leadership at a critical moment. After the fall of Sheikh Hasina, he came into prominence as the
                co-founder and spokesperson of the Inqilab Manch. His voice was clear and unwavering on issues such
                as justice for the July martyrs, ending impunity, political accountability, and resistance against
                state authoritarianism. He believed that a state survives through justice—not through fear or
                servitude.

                On December 12, 2025, he was shot in a planned armed attack in Paltan, Dhaka, and on December 18 he
                attained martyrdom at Singapore General Hospital. At just 32, his body fell silent, but the
                questions he raised, the struggles he waged, and the consciousness he ignited did not. Sharif Osman
                bin Hadi is no longer just a name; he is a legacy—one that continues to compel a new generation to
                stand up.
